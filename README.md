This is an analysis record to accompany the paper:

**YY1 binding is a gene-intrinsic barrier to Xist-mediated gene silencing**

bioRxiv 2023.11.22.568288; doi: [https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.22.568288](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.22.568288)

Scripts for allelic analysis of ATAC-seq data from a time-course of mESC-to-NPC differentiation in iXist-ChrX-Dom cells were run first:

[AllelicATAC_iXistChrXDom](AllelicATAC_iXistChrXDom.html) and then [AllelicATAC_EDM](AllelicATAC_iXistChrXDom.html). Plots included as panels of Figure2A can also be found within these records. 
 
 Following these two scripts, the records of the analysis performed to generate all other R plots in the paper can be found below:
