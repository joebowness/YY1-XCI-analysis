First, we run scripts for allelic analysis of ATAC-seq from the time-course of mESC-to-NPC differentiation in iXist-ChrX-Dom cells:
[AllelicATAC_iXistChrXDom](https://joebowness.github.io/YY1-XCI-analysis/AllelicATAC_iXistChrXDom.html) and then [AllelicATAC_EDM](https://joebowness.github.io/YY1-XCI-analysis/AllelicATAC_iXistChrXDom.html). Plots which form the panels of Figure2A can also be found within these records. 
 
 Following the first two scripts, the records of the analysis performed to generate all other R plots in the paper can be found below:

Most files which are loaded by these scripts have been uploaded to the "files" folder of this Github repository. Some larger raw data files (eg genome-wide "counts tables" outputs from featureCounts) are not attached but can be downloaded from GEO. The specific GEO accessions are provided in the analysis records.
